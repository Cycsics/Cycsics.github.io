                                <p>I have a strong interest in computers since I was a child, I has assembled a computer by myself when i was 8 years old. Learn C language and BASIC in junior high school, learn C ++ and Python in high school, and participate in China's high school student algorithm competition and get provincial awards</p>
								<p>During the undergraduate undergraduate, my mentor was Professor Zhao Zhiwen, dean of the Computer Academy of Beijing Normal University.</p>
                                <p>Under the leadership of <a href="https://zkgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/zngcyjyyyyjzx/rcdw15/97783.htm">Professor Zhao Zhiwen</a>, I independently completed an artificial intelligence -based gesture identification project, and served as Professor Zhao Zhiwen's assistant to teaching of the course called the "Artificial Intelligence Introduction".</p> 
                                <p> After graduating from undergraduate, joined <a href="http://www.cufitri.cn/">the Innovation Research Institute (Futian) of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</a></p> 
                                <p>Under the leadership of <a href="http://ri.cuhk.edu.hk/yhliu">Professor Liu Yunhui</a>, carried out scientific research based on artificial intelligence -based machine visual directions.</p>
                                <p>After studying the University of New South Wales for a master of coursework degree, still maintains the position of research assistants in Institute.</p>
